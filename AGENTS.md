# Project Overview

## App Shape

- This is a pure UIKit iOS app with programmatic setup. `MuseAmpTV/` is the tvOS shell target.
- Do not introduce SwiftUI for new UI work; all new screens, components, and overlays must use UIKit.
- App entry remains `MuseAmp/main.swift` -> `Application/AppDelegate.swift` -> `Application/SceneDelegate.swift`.
- TV app entry should remain `MuseAmpTV/main.swift` -> `MuseAmpTV/Application/TVAppDelegate.swift` -> `MuseAmpTV/Application/TVSceneDelegate.swift`.
- `Interface/Root/TabBarController.swift` owns the shared `AppEnvironment` reference for the compact tab shell.
- Compact root navigation currently uses first-level UIKit tabs for `Albums`, `Songs`, `Playlist`, optional `Search`, and `Settings`.
- Relaxed/Catalyst root navigation currently uses sidebar destinations for `Albums`, `Songs`, `Downloads`, `Playlist`, optional `Search`, and `Settings`.
- `Now Playing` is presented through `LNPopupController`, not as a first-level tab.

## Structure Rules

### Top Level

- `MuseAmp/` contains the app target source and resources.
- `MuseAmpTV/` contains the tvOS shell source and resources. Keep it limited to lifecycle/bootstrap plus the root state-machine shell and thin backend adapters.
- `MuseAmpDatabaseKit/` is the local library runtime package for file-backed library indexing, state, caches, downloads, playlists, and audit data.
- `SubsonicClientKit/` is a separate package for remote music service integration.
- `MuseAmpInterfaceKit/` is a separate UIKit package for cross-platform interface primitives and feature-facing UI contracts shared by iOS/iPadOS/tvOS.
- `MuseAmpPlayerKit/` is a separate package for playback engine integration.

### Application Layer

- `Application/` contains only app lifecycle and configuration: `AppDelegate.swift`, `SceneDelegate.swift`, `AppEnvironment.swift`, `AppEnvironment+Bootstrap.swift`, `AppEnvironment+Events.swift`, `AppEnvironment+Transfer.swift`, `AppPreferences.swift`.
- `MuseAmpTV/Application/` contains only tvOS lifecycle/bootstrap and the thin TV app context. Do not move iOS shell lifecycle types here, and do not grow it into a second full app environment layer.
- `Configuration/` (project root) contains shared Xcode build configuration files (`Base.xcconfig`, `Development.xcconfig`, `Release.xcconfig`, `Version.xcconfig`) used by both MuseAmp and MuseAmpTV targets.
- All domain logic lives under `Backend/`, not `Application/`.

### Backend Layer

- `Backend/API/`: `APIClient` and intent-level network entry points.
- `Backend/Downloads/`: download orchestration plus persisted download records.
- `Backend/Library/`: local and remote library data providers that bridge app services into browseable media collections.
- `Backend/Logging/`: file-backed logging and log reading. Extend this instead of adding a second diagnostics path.
- `Backend/Lyrics/`: lyrics fetching, parsing, and Chinese script conversion.
- `Backend/MenuProviders/`: shared UIKit menu and action provider helpers used by feature controllers.
- `Backend/Models/`: app-facing media models and adapter types used by the interface layer, including shared export/transfer models such as `SongExportItem`.
- `Backend/Playback/`: playback state ownership, playback domain models, and the shared `PlaybackController` bridge to `MuseAmpPlayerKit`.
- `Backend/Playlist/`: playlist CRUD, persistence, artwork generation, and `PlaylistCoverArtworkCache`.
- `Backend/Sync/`: local-network song transfer protocol models, sender/receiver session orchestration, Bonjour discovery/advertising, and transfer file preparation.
- `Backend/Supplement/`: cross-cutting utilities (metadata helpers, string sanitization, file name formatting, concurrency helpers).

### Interface Layer

- `Interface/Root/`: app shell hosting and root composition.
- `MuseAmpTV/Interface/Root/`: tvOS root state machine, shared-TV-screen hosting, and thin backend adapter wiring. Keep focus/navigation logic here rather than in `MuseAmpInterfaceKit`.
- `Interface/Root/BootProgressController.swift`: blocking library boot controller that initializes the local runtime before presenting the tab shell.
- `Interface/Common/`: shared loading, error, and infrastructure UI.
- `Interface/Common/` may contain thin compatibility shims that forward old app-target type names into `MuseAmpInterfaceKit` while feature migration is in progress.
- `Interface/Collections/`: reusable album and track presentation components.
- `Interface/Common/Presenters/SongExportPresenter.swift`: UI presenter for sharing/exporting songs (split from `Backend/MenuProviders/`).
- `Interface/Browse/`: browse-domain UIKit flows for local library navigation and drill-in screens.
- `Interface/Browse/Albums/`: album-library entry screens and their responsibility-based extensions.
- `Interface/Browse/Songs/`: song-library entry screens and their responsibility-based extensions.
- `Interface/Browse/AlbumDetail/`: album detail screens, album-only cells, and related presentation helpers.
- `Interface/Browse/Downloads/`: downloads browse UI and download-list presentation.
- `Interface/Browse/Support/`: browse-only helpers that are shared across album/song/download flows.
- `Interface/Search/`, `NowPlaying/`, `Playlist/`, `Settings/`: feature-owned UI outside the browse domain.
- `Interface/Sync/`: LAN transfer UIKit flows for sender setup, receiver discovery/manual connect, QR handoff, and transfer progress.
- `Interface/NowPlaying/Controller/`: main view controller and its responsibility-based extensions.
- `Interface/NowPlaying/ViewModel/`: view models for now playing state presentation.
- `Interface/NowPlaying/Sections/`: section views composing the now playing pages (avatar, center, list, lyric, transport).
- `Interface/NowPlaying/Components/`: reusable views and cells within now playing (LyricTimelineView, artwork background, queue cells, route picker).
- `Interface/NowPlaying/LyricSheet/`: lyric selection sheet controller.
- `Interface/NowPlaying/Support/`: logging and diagnostics helpers.

### Extension Layer

- `Extension/`: extensions on system/Apple framework types (UIColor, UIView, UITableView, Bundle, etc.), named `Extension+ClassName.swift`.

### General

- Keep UI state rendering in feature folders, but keep state ownership in `Backend/`.

### Album Menu Rules

- Album detail nav bar menus should be all-English and grouped in this order: download status first, playlist actions second, copy actions last.
- Album detail copy actions should be grouped under `Copy` and include `Copy Album Name`, `Copy Artist Name`, and `Copy All Song Names`.
- Album detail download action should be titled `Download All Songs`.
- If every album track is already downloaded, replace the album detail download action with a disabled `All Downloaded` action.
- Album detail `Save to Playlist` means adding the album tracks to an existing playlist. Its flow should be `Save to Playlist` -> `Add to Playlist` -> existing playlist choices, and it should only appear when at least one playlist exists.
- Album detail `Save as Playlist` means creating a new playlist from the whole album, using the album name as the playlist name, then adding every album track to it.
- Treat `Save to Playlist` and `Save as Playlist` as completely different actions. Do not use `Save as Playlist` for adding album tracks to an existing playlist, and do not use `Save to Playlist` for creating a playlist.
- Do not show `New Playlist…` or any create-playlist action inside the Album detail nav bar `Save to Playlist` flow.
- If playlist creation is offered in other screens, creating a playlist and then adding songs must continue the original add/save flow after creation.

## Placement Guide

- New app services belong under the closest `Backend/*` subdomain, not directly under `Backend/`.
- New network calls must extend `APIClient`; UI controllers must not construct raw endpoints.
- New persisted download data must continue to flow through `DownloadStore`; do not add a second store for the same records.
- New playback state and queue mutations must continue to flow through `PlaybackController`; mini player and now playing screens observe it.
- `PlaybackController` is responsible for local-vs-remote playback URL resolution, `MusicPlayerDelegate` bridging, and app-facing playback snapshots.
- New browse entry screens or browse drill-in flows should live under `MuseAmp/Interface/Browse/`, not under new top-level `Interface/*` siblings.
- New tab-level features that are outside the browse domain should usually get a new folder under `MuseAmp/Interface/`.
- Local-network transfer services and transport helpers belong under `Backend/Sync/`; transfer view controllers and QR/manual-connect flows belong under `Interface/Sync/`.
- `MuseAmpTV/Backend/Sync/` mirrors selected files from `MuseAmp/Backend/Sync/` via relative symlinks (e.g. `../../../MuseAmp/Backend/Sync/SyncProtocol.swift`). When adding a new Sync file that the tvOS target also needs to compile, create a matching symlink in `MuseAmpTV/Backend/Sync/` in the same change — the TV target will fail to resolve the type otherwise.
- Shared UI goes into `Interface/Common/` or `Interface/Collections/` only when it is used by more than one feature or is clearly cross-feature infrastructure.
- If a UI type is only used by one feature, keep it inside that feature folder even if it looks reusable.

## Dependency Rules

- Thread shared dependencies through `AppEnvironment`.
- Do not introduce new singletons for feature work.
- `APIClient` is the only app-level network orchestration entry point.
- UI code must not depend directly on `RemoteMusicService`.
- Settings flags go through `AppPreferences` and `ConfigurableKit`, not scattered `UserDefaults` keys.
- Use `FileManager.default` directly for standard file operations. Do not pass `FileManager` as a parameter or store it as a property.

## UIKit File Rules

- Keep `main.swift` as the entry point. Do not switch to `@main`.
- No `Main.storyboard`; keep only `LaunchScreen.storyboard` under `MuseAmp/Resources/`.
- Keep Xcode groups aligned with on-disk folders.
- Split large controllers using `XxxViewController.swift` plus focused `XxxViewController+Layout.swift`, `+Actions.swift`, `+Table.swift`, `+Search.swift`, or similar responsibility-based extensions.
- Split by responsibility, not by arbitrary line count.
- `CFBundleDocumentTypes` in `Info.plist` must stay M4A-only (`com.apple.m4a-audio`). Metadata embedding depends on this format.

## View Lifecycle Rules

- All `UITableView` / `UICollectionView` must use `UITableViewDiffableDataSource` / `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource`. No manual data-source mutations.
- **First load:** apply the initial snapshot in `viewDidLoad` with `animatingDifferences: false`. Data must be ready before `viewWillAppear`.
- Track a `hasAppliedInitialSnapshot` flag per controller; only subsequent snapshots may animate.
- Use `snapshot.reconfigureItems()` for in-place cell updates that preserve existing items.
- Disable animations during cell reconfigure/reload to avoid nav-bar flicker or layout jumps.
- Pre-alloc subviews and toggle `isHidden` instead of creating/destroying views during data updates.

## Animation Rules

- All UIView animations must go through `Interface` wrapper methods (`springAnimate`, `smoothSpringAnimate`, `bounceAnimate`, `quickAnimate`, `animate`, `transition`, `keyframeAnimate`). Never call `UIView.animate` or `UIView.transition` directly.
- These wrappers ensure `.beginFromCurrentState` and `.allowUserInteraction` are always applied.
- Set initial visual states in `viewDidLoad`, not in `viewWillAppear`.
- Do not call `layer.removeAllAnimations()`. Resume or transition from the current animation state.

## Cell Rules

- All table/collection cells inherit from `TableBaseCell` (MuseAmpInterfaceKit), which sets `selectionStyle = .none` and hides `selectedBackgroundView`.
- Never use `selectionStyle` to remove the gray tap highlight — only `selectedBackgroundView` visibility controls it.
- Haptic generators (`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light)`) must be stored as instance properties, not created on demand. Gate with `#if os(iOS)` for tvOS compatibility.

## Navigation Rules

- Push for feature drilling (album detail, playlist detail, settings sub-pages). Modal for temporary overlays (lyric sheet, input prompts).
- Modal presentation must always wrap the content controller in a `UINavigationController`.

## Combine Observation Rules

- Observe `PlaybackController` state via `$snapshot` publisher; use `.removeDuplicates { }` with custom equality to avoid redundant UI updates.
- Observe high-frequency playback time via `playbackTimeSubject` (`PassthroughSubject`), not the snapshot publisher.
- Observe download state via `DownloadManager.tasksPublisher` (`CurrentValueSubject`).
- Observe settings changes via `ConfigurableKit.publisher(forKey:type:)`.
- All Combine chains that touch UI must include `.receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)` before `.sink`.
- Always capture `[weak self]` in `.sink` closures; always `.store(in: &cancellables)`.

## Notification Rules

- Custom notification names are namespaced `"amusic.*"`: `.libraryDidSync`, `.artworkDidUpdate`, `.playlistArtworkDidUpdate`.
- User info keys are centralized in `AppNotificationUserInfoKey` (`trackIDs: [String]`, `playlistIDs: [UUID]`).
- Post notifications via `NotificationCenter.default`; no Combine `.publisher(for:)` wrappers.

## Feedback Presenter Rules

- User-facing toast feedback must go through centralized presenter enums, not direct `SPIndicator` calls.
- `PlaybackFeedbackPresenter` — play success, play-next result, add-to-queue, failure.
- `DownloadSubmissionFeedbackPresenter` — download submission result.
- Error feedback uses `AlertController`, never toasts. Progress-blocking actions use `ProgressActionPresenter`. Confirmations use `ConfirmationAlertPresenter`.

## Playback Interaction Rules

- Song tap: not playing → play immediately; playing current song → rewind; playing a different song not already next → enqueue as next (show `SPIndicator` via `PlaybackFeedbackPresenter`); already enqueued as next → skip to it.
- Only the enqueue path shows the toast.
- Lyrics and queue list header/footer spacers use hardcoded 200 pt, not viewport-fraction calculations.

## Search Rules

- Search debounce uses `Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)` with 300 ms delay plus a cancellable `debounceTask` property. No Combine debounce.
- Separate `debounceTask` (delay) and `searchTask` (network) properties allow independent cancellation.

## Localization Rules

- All user-facing strings in the app target use `String(localized:)`.
- Package-localized strings use `String(localized:bundle: .module)`.
- Every target that contains user-facing strings must keep them in a `Localizable.xcstrings` under its `Resources/` directory:
  - `MuseAmp/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`
  - `MuseAmpTV/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`
  - `MuseAmpDatabaseKit/Sources/MuseAmpDatabaseKit/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`
  - `MuseAmpPlayerKit/Sources/MuseAmpPlayerKit/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`
  - `SubsonicClientKit/Sources/SubsonicClientKit/Resources/Localizable.xcstrings`
- When adding or modifying any localized key, you must update the corresponding `.xcstrings` file in the same change.
- Each key must have a complete `localizations` block with both `en` and `zh-Hans`:
  - `en`: copy the key verbatim into `value` (preserve positional format specifiers such as `%1$@`, `%2$lld`, etc.).
  - `zh-Hans`: provide a correct Chinese translation, keeping the same format specifiers and positions.
- Do not leave empty entries (a key with no `localizations` object) in any `.xcstrings` file that is checked into the repo.
- If a string is no longer used, mark it stale or remove it; do not keep untranslated or orphaned keys.
- Run `make strip-xcstrings` before committing xcstrings edits and `make validate-xcstrings` to gate releases (see Build & Tooling Rules).

## Logging Rules

- All diagnostic output **must** go through `AppLog` (`MuseAmp/Backend/Logging/AppLog.swift`), which wraps Dog. Never use `print()`, `NSLog()`, `os_log`, or `debugPrint()` in app code.
- Every `catch` block or `try?` that silently swallows an error must log via `AppLog.error` or `AppLog.warning` before returning/continuing.
- Network requests (`APIClient` methods) must log at `.verbose` on entry and `.info` on success with key result metrics, and `.error` on failure.
- File I/O operations (reads, writes, deletes) in persistence stores must log failures via `AppLog.error` and optionally log success at `.verbose`.
- State transitions in core services (playback, downloads) should log at `.info`.
- Do not log sensitive data (tokens, full URLs with auth params). Redact or omit.

## API Verification

- When using iOS/macOS APIs that are new, recently changed, or unfamiliar, search Apple Developer Documentation (via the Apple-docs MCP tools) before writing the code.
- Verify availability annotations, parameter signatures, and deprecation status against the official docs rather than relying on memory alone.

## Code Style

- Indentation: 4 spaces.
- Use early returns and `guard` to reduce nesting.
- Prefer value types over reference types unless identity or UIKit lifecycle requires a class.
- Prefer dependency injection and composition over inheritance and singleton access.
- Use Swift concurrency features where they fit the existing design.
- Keep comments rare and only where they remove real ambiguity.
- Use the shared concurrency helpers in `Backend/Supplement/ConcurrencyHelpers.swift` (`UncheckedSendableBox`, `OnceGuard`, `ContinuationOnceGuard`) instead of defining ad-hoc box/guard types per file.
- When an `@unchecked Sendable` class gets "call to main actor-isolated instance method in a synchronous nonisolated context", fix by adding `nonisolated` to the class declaration or method. Do not restructure surrounding code.

## Property Rules

- Avoid unnecessary optionals. If a property can have a meaningful default value, use it instead of making the property optional.
- Combine subscriptions must be stored in a single `var cancellables: Set<AnyCancellable> = []` per class, using `.store(in: &cancellables)`. Do not create individual `AnyCancellable?` properties for each subscription.
- Callback closures that are always assigned before use should be non-optional with an empty default (e.g., `var onTap: () -> Void = {}`), not `(() -> Void)?`. Remove optional chaining (`?()`) at call sites.
- For throttle/cooldown dates, use `Date = .distantPast` instead of `Date?`. Check with `Date() < deadline` instead of unwrapping.
- For enum state properties, prefer a concrete default case (e.g., `.idle`) over making the property optional.
- Properties whose values can be derived from other state should be computed properties, not stored.
- Do not introduce stored properties to track state that is already available from an existing source of truth.

## Build & Tooling Rules

- Always drive build, test, and SwiftPM package-resolve operations through the top-level `Makefile`. Do not invoke `xcodebuild`, `xcrun xcodebuild`, or `swift test` directly from the shell.
- Build: `make build` (all), `make build-ios`, `make build-catalyst`, `make build-tvos`.
- Test: `make test` (runs tests on Mac Catalyst).
- `make build-ios` only compiles the app target. To verify test file changes, use `make test`.
- A shell exit code of `0` from `make build*` or `make test` is **not** proof of success. `xcodebuild` can exit `0` while the build/test actually failed, or while emitting warnings that must be addressed. Always read the full log output and verify: (1) no compiler errors, (2) no compiler warnings, (3) for `make test`, every test case reported as passed. Fix every warning and error surfaced in the logs before declaring the task complete.
- Package resolution + license refresh: `make package-resolve` (alias: `make scan-license`).
- Release flows that refresh licenses against an intentionally dirty tree must pass `dirty=1` (e.g. `make package-resolve dirty=1`); this is forwarded as `ALLOW_DIRTY=1` to the scan script.
- Format: `make format` (rewrite) or `make format-lint` (check only). Submodules under `Vendor/` and build artifacts are excluded automatically.
- Localization hygiene: `make strip-xcstrings` drops stale keys and syncs source-language values in every `Localizable.xcstrings`; `make validate-xcstrings` checks stale keys and missing translations across every locale the file already uses (discovered from the file itself).
- If a Makefile target is missing for an operation you need, add the target to the `Makefile` instead of shelling out to `xcodebuild`.

## Testing Rules

- The project has a macOS Catalyst destination. Tests can be built and run on Catalyst (`My Mac (Mac Catalyst)`) in addition to iOS simulators.
- Prefer behavior-focused tests over UI-structure tests.
- New tests should validate application logic, persistence, notifications, file processing, and service behavior without depending on view titles, tab counts/order, selected tabs, or other presentation-only details.
- Avoid assertions such as `.title == ...`, `tabs.count == ...`, or similar checks that only verify UIKit configuration text or shell layout.
- When testing UI-adjacent code, prefer asserting observable side effects or state changes rather than labels, tab wiring, or navigation chrome.

## Artwork URL Rules

- Artwork URLs use template strings with `{w}` and `{h}` placeholders. Always resolve via `apiClient.mediaURL(from:width:height:)`.
- Standard artwork size is **600×600** for downloads, playback tracks, and playlist entries.
- Never construct artwork URLs manually or hardcode dimensions without going through `APIClient.resolveMediaURL`.

## Menu Provider Rules

- Menu providers live under `Backend/MenuProviders/` and are injected into controllers as lazy properties initialized with `AppEnvironment`.
- Use `UIDeferredMenuElement.uncached { completion in }` for menus that need async or dynamic data.
- Group related actions with `MenuSectionProvider.inline()` (wraps in `UIMenu(options: .displayInline)`).
- Menu actions that depend on loaded data (e.g., album tracks, playlist songs) must fetch at action time via `@escaping () -> [T]` closures, not capture stale state.
- Async work inside `UIAction` handlers must use `Task { @MainActor in }`.

## Preferred Libraries

- Use `Kingfisher` for remote artwork loading and caching.
- Use `LRUCache` for bounded in-memory caches.
- Use `ConfigurableKit` for settings and debug pages.
- Use `Logger` (Dog) for diagnostics and log viewing.
- Use `SnapKit`, `Then` (includes `.with {}`) only when they reduce boilerplate without obscuring layout code.
- Use `SwifterSwift` for common Swift/UIKit extensions.
- Use `SPIndicator` for lightweight toast feedback, but only through the presenter enums in `Interface/Common/Presenters/`.
- Use `WCDBSwift` for database operations inside `MuseAmpDatabaseKit` only. App-level code uses model types, never WCDB rows directly.

## AlertController Rules

- Use `AlertController` for styled alerts, input prompts, and progress indicators.
- Single-button alerts: the action must always use `attribute: .accent`.
- Multi-button alerts: exactly one action should use `attribute: .accent`, preferably the rightmost one.

## Documentation Sync

- Any structural directory change must update this `AGENTS.md` in the same change.
- If a new subdomain is introduced under `Application/` or `Interface/`, document its scope and placement rules immediately.

# Package Reference

## Local Packages

### MuseAmpDatabaseKit

- **Path:** `MuseAmpDatabaseKit/`
- **Import:** `import MuseAmpDatabaseKit`
- **What:** Local library runtime — owns local index/state databases, file lifecycle, cache paths, playlists, downloads, and audit models behind `DatabaseManager`.
- **Key types:** `DatabaseManager`, `LibraryCommand`, `LibraryCommandResult`, `LibraryEvent`, `AudioTrackRecord`, `Playlist`, `DownloadJob`, `AuditSnapshot`
- **Layout:** keep the runtime split by responsibility across `DatabaseManager.swift` and `DatabaseManager+Scope.swift` files rather than regrowing one large implementation file.

### SubsonicClientKit

- **Path:** `SubsonicClientKit/`
- **Import:** `import SubsonicClientKit`
- **What:** Subsonic-backed music service layer — search, album/song lookup, lyrics, playback info, and Subsonic response mapping.
- **Key type:** `SubsonicMusicService(baseURL:username:password:)` with async methods: `ping()`, `search(query:type:limit:offset:cacheSearchResponses:prefetchSongMetadata:)`, `album(id:)`, `song(id:)`, `lyrics(id:)`, `playback(id:)`.
- **Models:** `CatalogSong`, `CatalogAlbum`, `CatalogArtist`, `Artwork` (with `imageURL(width:height:)`).

### MuseAmpInterfaceKit

- **Path:** `MuseAmpInterfaceKit/`
- **Import:** `import MuseAmpInterfaceKit`

### SnapKit

- **URL:** `https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit.git` (>= 5.7.0)
- **Import:** `import SnapKit`
- **What:** Chainable Auto Layout DSL.

#### Core API

```swift
view.snp.makeConstraints { make in
    make.edges.equalToSuperview().inset(16)
}
view.snp.updateConstraints { make in   // update constants only
    make.height.equalTo(200)
}
view.snp.remakeConstraints { make in   // remove + recreate
    make.center.equalToSuperview()
}
```

#### Attributes

- Single: `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`, `leading`, `trailing`, `width`, `height`, `centerX`, `centerY`
- Composite: `edges`, `size`, `center`, `horizontalEdges`, `verticalEdges`

#### Modifiers

- `.offset(value)` — constant offset
- `.inset(value)` — inward insets (CGFloat, UIEdgeInsets, NSDirectionalEdgeInsets)
- `.multipliedBy(factor)` — proportional sizing
- `.priority(.required | .high | .medium | .low)` — layout priority
- `.labeled(name)` — debug label

### Then

- **URL:** `https://github.com/devxoul/Then.git` (>= 3.0.0)
- **Import:** `import Then`
- **What:** Syntactic sugar for object init/config via trailing closures. Includes `.with {}` (no separate "With" package).

#### API

```swift
// .then — configure reference types inline (NSObject subclasses)
let label = UILabel().then {
    $0.textAlignment = .center
    $0.textColor = .black
    $0.text = "Hello"
}

// .with — copy-and-modify value types
let frame = oldFrame.with { $0.size.width = 200 }

// .do — side effects, returns Void
UserDefaults.standard.do {
    $0.set("value", forKey: "key")
}
```

- All `NSObject` subclasses conform automatically.
- Custom types: `extension MyType: Then {}`

### LRUCache

- **URL:** `https://github.com/nicklockwood/LRUCache` (>= 1.0.0)
- **Import:** `import LRUCache`
- **What:** Thread-safe LRU cache replacing `NSCache` with predictable eviction. Auto-clears on memory warning.

```swift
let cache = LRUCache<String, UIImage>(countLimit: 100, totalCostLimit: 50 * 1024 * 1024)
cache.setValue(image, forKey: key, cost: dataSize)
let image = cache.value(forKey: key)
cache.removeValue(forKey: key)
cache.removeAll()
```

### ConfigurableKit

- **URL:** `https://github.com/Lakr233/ConfigurableKit` (>= 1.0.0)
- **Import:** `import ConfigurableKit`
- **What:** Declarative UIKit settings page builder synced to UserDefaults.

#### Key types

- `ConfigurableObject` — settings item (icon, title, explain, key, defaultValue, annotation)
- `ConfigurableManifest` — group container with title/footer
- `ConfigurableViewController` / `ConfigurableSheetController` — presentation
- Annotations: `.boolean`, `.slider`, `.picker`, etc.
- `whenValueChange(type:)` — observe setting changes
- `ConfigurableKit.storage` — swap in custom `KeyValueStorage`

### Dog (Logger)

- **URL:** `https://github.com/Lakr233/Dog` (branch: `main`)
- **Import:** `import Dog`
- **What:** File-backed persistent logging with log retrieval for in-app viewer.

```swift
Dog.shared.initialization(writableDir: logsDir)
Dog.shared.join(self, "message", level: .info)   // .verbose | .info | .warning | .error | .critical
let content = Dog.shared.obtainCurrentLogContent()
let paths = Dog.shared.obtainAllLogFilePath()
```
